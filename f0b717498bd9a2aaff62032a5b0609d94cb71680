I do not have a solid understanding of all the details, I just pieced this together by looking through related changes in LineageOS repos.\n\nI did however test this on my Poco X3 NFC, and with these changes I can set a charging limit, the phone stops charging when reaching the limit, and it starts charging again when dropping 10 percentage points under the limit, so to me it looks like it works as intended.",

The Change-Id comes from repo afaik and the author info from git, so what is incorrect about them?\nAre you implying this is a copy of the commits submitted under that Change-Id? If so, you are mistaken - while I would have appreciated if the response I was given in IRC/Discord had consisted of this link instead of passive-aggressiveness from luk, I was not aware of these commits until after I put my weekend into getting this to work.\nObviously those changes still are extremely similar, but they do the same thing, so how wouldn\u0027t they.\n\nThe commit tile I chose to be similar to https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_oneplus_sdm845-common/commit/9aa837941ecad69eaebfd53aa9582efb45ced66a which is pretty much the only charging limits related change I found via Google.",
